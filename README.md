This is a registration portal for vehicles. It has functionality for adding, deleting, searching,
and displaying the full registry of vehicle numbers. It accepts "numbers" as long as they have
exclusively uppercase letters and/or numbers, meaning a "number" can in theory just be a word
without any actual numbers comprising it. It orders the list of vehicle numbers in an ascending
order, but not descending. I wasn't able to figure out how to make it have the option to take me
back to the main menu after selecting something. After the user is done, they can exit the app
through the main menu.
